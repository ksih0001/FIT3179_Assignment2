        <p>
          This report examines Malaysia's road safety through three lenses: (1) regional benchmarking of mortality rates (2003–2019), (2) national
          exposure–outcome trends (2003–2016), and (3) state-level deaths and population-standardized rates (2003–2019). From 2003 to 2016,
          motorization and reported crashes rose substantially, while deaths increased only modestly and deaths per 100 crashes declined—indicating
          improved survivability. States vary widely in both per-capita risk and absolute burden, motivating risk-focused prevention in high-rate states
          and capacity-focused EMS/trauma investments where burdens are highest, alongside national action on speed, protective-device compliance, and
          post-crash care.
        </p>

    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section aria-labelledby="intro-title">
      <h2 id="intro-title">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Malaysia's motorization has expanded rapidly, bringing both opportunity and risk. Between 1997 and 2016, vehicle registrations more than
        tripled and reported crashes rose sharply, yet deaths grew modestly and deaths per crash declined—the "severity paradox" consistent with
        safer vehicles, targeted enforcement, engineering improvements, and enhanced emergency care. Crash volumes remain high and risk is uneven
        across states. This report separates population-standardized risk from absolute burden and applies same-year benchmarks to support fair,
        actionable comparisons.

      <div class="terminology" role="note" aria-label="Terminology and measures">
        <h3>Terminology and Measures</h3>
        <p><strong>Risk</strong> = mortality rate per 100,000 population (state-year deaths ÷ state-year population × 100,000).</p>
        <p><strong>Burden</strong> = absolute deaths (system load on EMS and trauma care).</p>
        <p><strong>Severity</strong> = deaths per 100 crashes (national deaths ÷ national crashes × 100).</p>
        <p>The "national benchmark" used for state comparisons is computed from state sums for the same year to ensure like-for-like comparison.</p>

      <h2 id="s2">National Trends: The Severity Paradox (2003–2016)</h2>
      <p class="method-box">
        Pair exposure and outcomes to demonstrate decoupling—vehicles and crashes rose rapidly (+116% and +75%), deaths rose moderately (+14%),
        and deaths per crash declined significantly (−35%). Together, the views explain the "severity paradox."

          <p class="viz-caption">
            Between 2003 and 2016, Malaysia experienced substantial growth in vehicle ownership (+116%, 12.8M → 27.6M) and reported crashes (+75%, 299K → 521K).
            However, road deaths rose more modestly (+14%, 6,286 → 7,152), resulting in a dramatic decline in crash lethality (−35%, 2.10% → 1.37%).
            This pattern reflects enhanced vehicle safety technology, improved emergency medical services, infrastructure investments, and incremental enforcement improvements.

            The fatal share contracts over time: deaths per 100 crashes fell from ~2.10% (2003) to ~1.37% (2016)—a 35% reduction in fatality risk conditional
            on being involved in a crash. Notably, while serious and slight injuries decreased substantially (serious: 9,040 → 4,506; slight: 37,415 → 7,415),
            absolute deaths increased from 6,286 to 7,152 (+14%). This paradox—declining crash severity alongside rising absolute fatalities—underscores the
            challenge posed by growing crash volumes overwhelming safety improvements.

    <!-- DISCUSSION -->
    <section aria-labelledby="disc">
      <h2 id="disc">Discussion and Policy Implications</h2>
      <p>
        Malaysia's road safety landscape presents a complex picture requiring nuanced, differentiated interventions rather than uniform national
        approaches. Three key findings emerge:
      </p>
      <h3>1. The Severity Paradox: National Progress with Local Variation</h3>
      <p>
        At the national level, Malaysia has improved crash survivability. Deaths per 100 crashes fell markedly over 2003–2016, consistent with safer
        vehicles, stronger enforcement, engineering improvements, and better emergency care. However, this aggregate progress masks heterogeneity.
        Crash volumes rose substantially over the same period, so exposure prevention—not only post‑crash mitigation—remains essential.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Geographic Heterogeneity Demands Differentiated Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Risk and burden concentrate unequally across states, requiring tailored interventions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Risk-focused measures</strong> (for high per-capita rates): Perlis, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Perak, Pahang all exceed 25 deaths per
        100,000—well above the national average of 22.3. Interventions include intensive speed enforcement, blackspot engineering, behavioral campaigns.
        Success model: W.P. KL achieved 11.7 per 100,000 despite extreme traffic density through infrastructure, public transport, and enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Burden-focused investments</strong> (for high absolute deaths): Selangor (1,054) and Johor (1,040) alone account for 32% of national
deaths. These states require EMS capacity expansion, trauma center staffing, surge management protocols for festive periods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deterioration investigations</strong>: Perlis (+40.7% 2003-2019), Sarawak (+27.2%), Kelantan (+7.6%) require urgent diagnostic audits.
        Federal government should mandate systematic reviews and corrective action plans.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Transparency and Accountability Through Standardized Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        Federal authorities should mandate annual state-level scorecards reporting population-standardized rates, absolute counts, and benchmark
        deviations, with public disclosure and performance-linked resource allocation. States consistently above-average in risk should receive
        targeted prevention resources; states with high absolute burdens should receive capacity investments; states showing deteriorating trends
        should face mandatory audits and corrective plans.
      </p>
